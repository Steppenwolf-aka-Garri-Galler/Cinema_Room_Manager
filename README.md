# Cinema_Room_Manager
In the 3.0 version we added a feature which helps the user to know how much the ticket will be cost according to the row and a preferrable seat.Also,after selecting the
coordinates, the program prints everything one more time but with "B" sign on the user's coordinates.  
3.1 - added comments in order to understand my own code,lmao :)
